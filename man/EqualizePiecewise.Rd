\title{Piecewise Affine Histogram Equalization}
\usage{
EqualizePiecewise(im, N, smax = 255, smin = 0, range = c(0, 255))
}
\arguments{
\item{im}{a grayscale image of class cimg}

\item{N}{number of subintervals of partition. N controls how the input gray levels will be mapped in the output image.
if N is large, Piecewise Affine Equalization and Histogram Equalization are very similar.}

\item{smax}{maximum value of slopes. if smax is small, contrast enhancement is suppressed.}

\item{smin}{minimum value of slopes. if smin is large, contrast enhancement is propelled, and saturations occur excessively.}

\item{range}{range of the pixel values of image. this function assumes that the range of pixel values of of an input image is [0,255] by default. you may prefer [0,1].
if you change range, you should change smax. one example is this (smax = range[2] - range[1]).}
}
\value{
a grayscale image of class cimg
}

enhance contrast of image by piecewise affine histogram equalization
