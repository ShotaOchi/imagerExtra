\usage{
SegmentCV(
  im,
  mu = 0.25,
  nu = 0,
  lambda1 = 1,
  lambda2 = 1,
  tol = 1e-04,
  maxiter = 500,
  dt = 0.5,
  initial,
  returnstep
)
}
\arguments{
\item{im}{a grayscale image of class cimg}

\item{mu}{length penalty}

\item{nu}{area penalty}

\item{lambda1}{fit weight inside the curve}

\item{lambda2}{fit weight outside the curve}

\item{tol}{convergence tolerance}

\item{maxiter}{maximum number of iterations}

\item{dt}{time step}

\item{initial}{"interactive" or a grayscale image of class cimg. you can define initial condition as a rectangle shape interactively if initial is "interactive". If initial is a grayscale image of class cimg, pixels whose values are negative will be treated as outside of contour. pixels whose values are non-negative will be treated as inside of contour. checker board condition will be used if initial is not specified.}

\item{returnstep}{a numeric vector that determines which result will be returned. 0 means initial condition, and 1 means the result after 1 iteration. final result will be returned if returnstep is not specified.}
}
\value{
a pixel set or a list of lists of numeric and pixel set
}
\description{
iterative image segmentation with Chan-Vese model

\examples{
layout(matrix(1:2, 1, 2))
g <- grayscale(dogs)
plot(g, main = "Original")
SegmentCV(g, lambda2 = 15) \%>\% plot(main = "Binarized")
